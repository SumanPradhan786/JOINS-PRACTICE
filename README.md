IN THIS INTERNSHIP I WAS LEARN ABOUT :- Design and implement database schemas: This involves understanding data relationships and creating efficient table structures.

Write complex SQL queries: You'll master various clauses like SELECT, FROM, WHERE, JOIN (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL), GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY to retrieve, filter, and aggregate data effectively.

Perform data manipulation (DML): This includes using INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements to manage data within tables.

Understand and apply Data Definition Language (DDL): You'll work with CREATE, ALTER, and DROP commands for database objects.

Optimize query performance: Learning to analyze execution plans and rewrite queries for speed is a crucial skill.

Work with different SQL dialects (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle): Exposure to various systems broadens your understanding of SQL's versatility.

Collaborate with teams: You'll likely work with developers, data analysts, or other stakeholders, gaining experience in a professional environment.

Troubleshoot database issues: Identifying and resolving problems related to data integrity, performance, or connectivity is a common aspect of the role.
